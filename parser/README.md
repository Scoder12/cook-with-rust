# cook-with-rust-parser

This is a parser crate for the [CookLang](https://github.com/cooklang/spec).  The main feature is parsing a String into a
struct that implements serde and can be easily used from there.

The implementation is nearly fully complete. Only image tags are missing. They are just ignored by now.
